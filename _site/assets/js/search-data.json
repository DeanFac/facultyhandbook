Some of the common things to keep in mind are listed below: . | Please ensure that exit routes are identified and displayed in the research facilities and are always free of obstacles. In general, it is a good practice to ensure that not more than 3 doors need to be opened to go outside the building. | Passages have to be at least 5 feet wide. | Make sure all electric wirings are appropriately concealed. Periodically, check for earthing issues. | Always ensure that a duplicate key (office and lab) is deposited at the building’s office. | Please ensure appropriate personal protective apparel (gloves, masks, goggles, lab coats, etc.) are provided for in the lab. Insist on appropriate footwear. | If heavier / sharper objects (including gas cylinders and containers) are routinely handled, they should be chained/ restrained, and not free standing. | All labs should have first-aid kits. Check periodically to ensure that they are within their expiry date. | It is a good practice to ensure that at least one other person is present while conducting experiments. | Hazardous waste (oil, flammable liquids, solvents, corrosive liquids, process wastes/residues and sludges, filters and filter materials, contaminated containers) have to be stored in stored in container / drums under covered shed and appropriately labelled. Periodically, Engineering Unit will send out an email notification to all departments to dispose these. | E-waste &amp; outdated/ non-functioning equipment which have Stores Received Book (SRB) entries have to be disposed through a condemnation committee coordinated by department office/ stores. | To dispose radioactive material, contact the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) who will in turn connect with the approved vendor and approve the disposal. | TO CHECK: Bio Medical Waste Disposal should be done through registered vendors. While there is no centralized process for this, contact the department for guidelines. | IITM Institutional Human/ Animal Ethics Committee’s approval is mandatory for academic research projects, which involve the participation of human/ animal subjects and volunteers. | Research proposals involving recombinant and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)/systems, or pathogenic microorganisms require approval from the Institutional Biosafety committee (IBSC) before commencement. All proposals must be submitted against a call to the IBSC (Email: ibsc@zmail.iitm.ac.in). | . There are specific rules for disposal of chemicals, hazardous and biomedical waste.
