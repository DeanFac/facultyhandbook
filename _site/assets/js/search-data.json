FACULTY ADVISOR: Departments assign students from course-based programs (B. Tech, M. Tech., MSc., MA, MBA, etc.) as advisees of the faculty. In addition, all graduate students guided by faculty for their project/ thesis are his/her advisees by default. Faculty advisors have to: . | Keep track of advisees’ academic progress | Help advisees in coursework management. | Approve (via Workflow) the courses that the advisees have registered for every semester. While approving, (a) Look at the advisees’ past semester records to understand their ability to handle courses. Restrict the advisees with difficulty in handling courses from registering for more/ difficult courses. Explain the rationale to them. (b) Ensure that the students do not drop the core courses (regular/ backlog) that they need to complete in that particular semester. (c) Ensure that backlog courses, especially core courses, are given priority while they register, so that they clear them as soon as possible. | Meet each advisee every month and complete Kushal form. This is mandatory. If advisee appears to have issues of any kind, email: acad-support@smail.iitm.ac.in immediately with a copy to HOD and Dean of Students. | . ",

Some of the common things to keep in mind are listed below: . | Please ensure that exit routes are identified and displayed in the research facilities and are always free of obstacles. In general, it is a good practice to ensure that not more than 3 doors need to be opened to go outside the building. | Passages have to be at least 5 feet wide. | Make sure all electric wirings are appropriately concealed. Periodically, check for earthing issues. | Always ensure that a duplicate key (office and lab) is deposited at the building’s office. | Please ensure appropriate personal protective apparel (gloves, masks, goggles, lab coats, etc.) are provided for in the lab. Insist on appropriate footwear. | If heavier / sharper objects (including gas cylinders and containers) are routinely handled, they should be chained/ restrained, and not free standing. | All labs should have first-aid kits. Check periodically to ensure that they are within their expiry date. | It is a good practice to ensure that at least one other person is present while conducting experiments. | Hazardous waste (oil, flammable liquids, solvents, corrosive liquids, Process wastes/residues and sludges, Filters and filter materials, contaminated containers) have to be stored in Stored in Container / drums under covered shed and appropriately labelled. Periodically, EU will send out an email notification to all departments to dispose these. | E-waste &amp; outdated/ non-functioning equipment which have SRB entries have to be disposed through a condemnation committee coordinated by department office/ stores. | To dispose radioactive material, contact the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) who will in turn connect with the approved vendor and approve the disposal. | TO CHECK: Bio Medical Waste Disposal should be done through registered vendors. While there is no centralized process for this, contact the department for guidelines. | IITM Institutional Human/ Animal Ethics Committee’s approval is mandatory for academic research projects, which involve the participation of human/ animal subjects and volunteers. | Research proposals involving recombinant and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)/systems, or pathogenic microorganisms require approval from the Institutional Biosafety committee (IBSC) before commencement. All proposals must be submitted against a call to the IBSC(Email: ibsc@zmail.iitm.ac.in) | .
