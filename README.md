# Pushing the content to your own fachandbook repository

> [!NOTE]
> Note that, the repository is now in your local computer, you cannot push it back to
my repository (narasimhan-2604/fachandbook) as you do not have write permissions. 
So, you need to create a repo, in your github account and push changes there. Here are the steps

### Create a new empty repo on GitHub called 'fachandbook' via the GitHub website. 
You can google this up or ask ChatGPT nicely, if you do not know how to do it.

### Disconnect the current remote
This removes, my repo as the target for pushing

```git remote remove origin```

### Link your new repository
This makes your repo as the target where changes will be for pushed

```git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/fachandbook.git```

### Push to your changes (if you made any) to the new repository

The following commands, will push the content to your repo.
```git branch -M main```
```git push -u origin main```
