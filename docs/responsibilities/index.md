The Roles and responsibilities of faculty members are classified into three categories:

* **Teaching**  
* **Research and Projects**  
* **Mentoring students & Student projects**  
* **Administration**

Every academic and administrative process requires a chain of approvals so as to bring it to a logical conclusion. As part of this chain, faculty will be required to approve/reject various academic and administrative processes. All such tasks awaiting action will be listed under “Tasks” in Workflow. 

Some tasks are ***auto approved*** (SLA- Service Level Approval) after a fixed time to avoid delays in other related processes. However, faculty will still be responsible for tasks auto approved under SLA.  So, **log in to workflow every day and clear these tasks.**
