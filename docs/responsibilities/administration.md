# Administration

## General approvals

* Every academic and administrative process requires a chain of approvals so as to bring it to a logical conclusion. 
As part of this chain, faculty will be required to approve/reject various academic and administrative processes. 
All such tasks awaiting action will be listed under “Tasks” in Workflow. 

* Some tasks are **auto approved** (SLA- Service Level Approval) after a fixed time to avoid delays in other related processes.
However, faculty will still be responsible for tasks auto approved under SLA. So, **log in to workflow every day and clear these tasks**

## Faculty advisor:
* **Departments assign students from course-based programs (B. Tech, M. Tech., MSc., MA, MBA, etc.) as advisees of the faculty. In addition, all graduate students guided by faculty for their project/ thesis are his/her advisees by default. Faculty advisors have to:
    * Keep track of advisees’ academic progress 
    * Help advisees in coursework management 
    * Approve (via Workflow) the courses that the advisees have registered for every semester. While approving, 
      * Look at the advisees’ past semester records to understand their ability to handle courses. Restrict the advisees with difficulty in handling courses from registering for more/ difficult courses. Explain the rationale to them.
      * Ensure that backlog courses, especially core courses, are given priority while they register, so that they clear them as soon as possible
      * Meet each advisee every month and complete Kushal form at [https://kushal.iitm.ac.in:9001/](https://kushal.iitm.ac.in:9001/). **This is mandatory.** If advisee appears to have issues of any kind, email: [acad-support@smail.iitm.ac.in](mailto:acad-support@smail.iitm.ac.in) 
       immediately with a copy to HOD and Dean of Students.
