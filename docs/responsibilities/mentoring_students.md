# Mentoring Students & Student Projects

Faculty are also expected to advice a set of students assigned to them on academic matters and also, mentor students in their project work (M. Tech/ M.Sc./ MA/ MBA). 

**FACULTY ADVISOR:** Departments assign students from course-based programs (B. Tech, M. Tech., MSc., MA, MBA, etc.) as advisees of the faculty. In addition, all graduate students guided by faculty for their project/ thesis are his/her advisees by default. Faculty advisors have to:

1.	Keep track of advisees’ academic progress
2.	Help advisees in coursework management. 
3.	Approve (via Workflow) the courses that the advisees have registered for every semester. While approving,
a.	Look at the advisees’ past semester records to understand their ability to handle courses. Restrict the advisees with difficulty in handling courses from registering for more/ difficult courses. Explain the rationale to them.  
b.	Ensure that the students do not drop the core courses (regular/ backlog) that they need to complete in that particular semester.
c.	Ensure that backlog courses, especially core courses, are given priority while they register, so that they clear them as soon as possible. 
4.	Meet each advisee every month and complete Kushal form at https://kushal.iitm.ac.in:9001/. **This is mandatory.** If advisee appears to have issues of any kind, email: acad-support@smail.iitm.ac.in  immediately with a copy to HOD and Dean of Students.
