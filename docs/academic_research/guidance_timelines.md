# Research scholars: Guidance and timelines

**A committee/ panel is setup** within one semester from the date of joining of the research scholars to review their progress and address any academic issues faced by the student or the guide. The guide has to initiate the formation of the committee  by suggesting possible panel members through workflow (Academics \> Research Scholar \> Panel Nomination). The nature of the committee and its composition are listed below.

| Program | Committee | Composition | Panel suggestions by Guide over workflow |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| MS | Graduate Test Committee (GTC) | Chairperson (HoD/ representative) Guide/ Co-guide 1 internal member (from the parent Dept of the Guide) 1 external member (from another Dept within IITM) | Co-guide, if any 3 internal and 3 external members, from whom HoD will choose one each |
| PhD | Doctoral Committee (DC) | Chairperson (HoD/ representative) Guide/ co-guide 2 internal members (from the parent Dept of the Guide) 1 external member (from another Dept within IITM) | Co-guide, if any 4 internal and 4 external members, from whom HoD will 2 and 1, respectively |

# Minimum Coursework Requirements: (XX implies Dept code. Ex: ME for Mechanical)

| Program |Minimum Courses |Minimum Credits |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| MS \+ PhD / Upgraded PhD | 8, XX6999 and XX7999 |72 |
| PhD | 4 | 36 |
| MS | 5 | 45 |

* Guides have to prescribe the courses through workflow (Academics :arrow_right: Research Scholar :arrow_right: Prescription of Courses) and it has to be approved by the respective committee/ panel.
* Typically, twice the number of courses are suggested by guide/ DC/ GTC for the student to choose from.
* Scholars can take more courses if they want and if the guide permits.   
* ID6020 (Introduction to Research, Institute module) is mandatory for everyone, in addition to the recommended courses. In addition, some Departments may have a Departmental module (XX6021).
