# PhD thesis evaluation

A two-track policy is followed for PhD thesis evaluation.

   2. Guide suggests 2 reviewers (can be from IITM or outside) after confirming their willingness by e-mail. The thesis will be sent to the 2 examiners and viva voce is scheduled once one of the reviews is received.   
   
2) Track A:  
   1. If 70% or more of the thesis has not been published  
   2. Guide suggests 6 reviewers (at least 2 from outside IITM) after confirming their willingness by e-mail. The thesis will be sent to 2 of these examiners (chosen by Dean AR) and viva voce is scheduled once both the reviews are received.
