# MS Thesis evaluations

For MS Thesis evaluation, guide suggests 2 examiners. HoD will choose one examiner. Examiner is given 4 weeks' time to give a report. If the reviewer commens are received, the candidate has to give response and revise the thesis, and send it to GTC. Based on the response, GTC may recommend/ waive the viva. If reviewer comments are not received in 4 weeks, MS thesis viva is conducted to consider awarding the degree.

   2. Guide suggests 2 reviewers (can be from IITM or outside) after confirming their willingness by e-mail. The thesis will be sent to the 2 examiners and viva voce is scheduled once one of the reviews is received.   
   
2) Track A:  
   1. If 70% or more of the thesis has not been published  
   2. Guide suggests 6 reviewers (at least 2 from outside IITM) after confirming their willingness by e-mail. The thesis will be sent to 2 of these examiners (chosen by Dean AR) and viva voce is scheduled once both the reviews are received.
