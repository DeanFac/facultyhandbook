Please note that provision of quarters on campus is a privilege accorded and not an entitlement.

When new faculty join, IIT Madras may provide a temporary 1-bedroom accommodation subject to availability until a quarters is allotted.

Sometimes, it may be worthwhile to apply for a quarters, even if the chances of getting it is remote, just to know tentative position in the seniority list. However, do not apply if you don't like the quarters.
