# Living Outside Campus

Nearby residential locations for off-campus accommodation: Adyar, Besant Nagar, Indiranagar, Kotturpuram, Velachery, Taramani, Perungudi and Thiruvanmiyur. 

Staying outside will involve costs on rent, commuting, etc. which have to be balanced against HRA (partially tax-free), license fee, etc. and the convenience of staying on campus.
