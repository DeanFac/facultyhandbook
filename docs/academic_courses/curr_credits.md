# Curriculum and credits

Course-based core programs follow a given curriculum which is revised periodically (typically once in 5-10 years) 
See this [link](https://www.iitm.ac.in/academics/academic-curricula) for curricula.

* The curriculum includes suggested semester-wise course work.   
* Curriculum involves a combination of core (mandatory) and elective courses in various categories (basic sciences- S; basic engineering- E; humanities-H; professional- P; management-M; computing- C; general- G).   
* The students are expected to put in certain number of credit hours (1 credit hour \= 50 mins) of effort every week for each course  
  * ‘L’ classroom lectures   
  * ‘T’ tutorial sessions  
  * ‘E’ extended tutorial sessions  
  * ‘P’ lab sessions  
  * ‘O’ preparation outside formal classroom engagement. Typically, a student is supposed to spend 2 hours of time preparing for every 1 credit hour of lecture. 

L+T+E+P+O \= the total number of credits assigned to the particular course. 

* A minimum number of course credits are required to be completed in various categories to complete a degree. 

IIT Madras follows a system, where each course or lab is assigned a slot (A–H, J–M, P–S). 
The academic timetable with slots is available [here](https://www.iitm.ac.in/academics/academic-services/timetable).

# Course allotment
Faculty of the department meet and decide the respective courses to be offered during the subsequent semester as per the following schedule:
* Odd Sem (July-Nov) - done in February  
* Even Sem (Jan- May) - done in September


# Course registration and add/drop

Students typically register for the subsequent semester courses at the end of current semester. 
At the beginning of a semester, the students may request to add/ drop course(s) 
through workflow during the allotted window as per the academic calendar. The faculty advisor and 
course faculty need to approve the requests through workflow.
