# Administration

All administrative activities in this academic institute are ultimately supervised and approved by faculty, and hence, it is the responsibility of every faculty to support the institute by taking up administrative roles. 

*Among the various administrative responsibilities, listed below (not exhaustive), faculty can contribute in the ones that they feel passionate about. While the faculty can say no to some of the administrative responsibilities that do not suit them, don’t say no to everything!*
