# Mentoring Students & Student Projects

Faculty are also expected to advice a set of students assigned to them on academic matters and also, mentor students in their project work (M. Tech/ M.Sc./ MA/ MBA). 

**FACULTY ADVISOR:** Departments assign students from course-based programs (B. Tech, M. Tech., MSc., MA, MBA, etc.) as advisees of the faculty. In addition, all graduate students guided by faculty for their project/ thesis are his/her advisees by default. Faculty advisors have to:

1.	Keep track of advisees’ academic progress
2.	Help advisees in coursework management. 
3.	Approve (via Workflow) the courses that the advisees have registered for every semester. While approving,<br>
(a)	Look at the advisees’ past semester records to understand their ability to handle courses. Restrict the advisees with difficulty in handling courses from registering for more/ difficult courses. Explain the rationale to them. <br> 
(b)	Ensure that the students do not drop the core courses (regular/ backlog) that they need to complete in that particular semester. <br>
(c)	Ensure that backlog courses, especially core courses, are given priority while they register, so that they clear them as soon as possible. <br>
4.	Meet each advisee every month and complete [Kushal form](https://kushal.iitm.ac.in:9001/). **This is mandatory.** If advisee appears to have issues of any kind, email: [acad-support@smail.iitm.ac.in](acad-support@smail.iitm.ac.in)  immediately with a copy to HOD and Dean of Students.
