# Evaluation Pattern

Clearly communicate the evaluation pattern. Later it must be approved by Class Committee (constituted by the department in the beginning of the semester to ensure the smooth conduct of the course).   

Typical evaluation pattern: 20-30% each for Quiz I & Quiz II, 0-20% for assignments.

{: .highlight}
**40-60% (to be strictly adhered for theory courses) for an end semester exam.**     


# Letter grades and points

Different letter grades carry the following points:

| Grade  | S | A | B | C | D | E | U |
|:----| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Points | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 4 | 0 |

The following guidelines can be used for determining the cut-off marks for different grades after sorting the marks in ascending/ descending order:


(i)  Class size is more than 50:

(ii) Class size between 20 and 50:

There is no specific guideline recommended for small classes. These are just guidelines and not mandatory. 

{: .highlight}
It is a good practice to keep the cut-off where there is a significant gap in the marks since a change in grade represents a significant interval in grade points.  
  
  
# Time frame for Evaluation

* The answer scripts for quiz I & quiz II need to be returned within one week. 
* Uploading final grades in the workflow has to be completed before a given deadline (indicated in the academic calendar, typically 10 days after the last end semester exam).


{: .highlight}
It is **MANDATORY** to stick to this deadline as otherwise it affects the academic operations severely.

* For help with uploading grades, view [this video](https://cc.iitm.ac.in/files/grade_upload.mp4) or [the help document on workflow](https://workflow.iitm.ac.in/employee/DynamicContainer/Packages/Acad_Grade%20Approval/Activities//Upload%20Grades/ISpace/100/1024%20x%20768/MasterForm/ISpace.aspx?PId=51&PkSuActMId=2173F6FD-A683-47C8-9FF1-140128FBA3D9&PkActMId=a1cb43d9-2001-42c3-baf5-6ad05c08a4f0&ReId=587D0C7D-3A13-473E-9F66-67EBA13BB7AA&FId=100&AId=323&PkPrMId=761fef62-94e0-4711-9fd8-3a5ee7912da3&RsNa=1024%20x%20768&RfNa=MasterForm&SID=74A455F1-7BEE-400A-B0A2-9C82AF015E2F#).

* After the grades are uploaded by instructor, the Class Committee chairman has to approve.
