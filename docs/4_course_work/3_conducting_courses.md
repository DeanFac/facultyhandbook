# Dept. Course allotment 
Faculty of the department meet and decide the respective courses to be offered during the subsequent semester as per the following schedule:
* Odd Sem (July-Nov) - done in February  
* Even Sem (Jan- May) - done in September


# General Guidelines while offering a Course
The department office will share a list with details of courses to be offered during the upcoming semester. At this point faculty should check: <br>
(a) if the slots in which their courses are offered clash with other courses. Attention (or lack thereof) can be important in the following ways:<br> 
(i) the slot of an elective course the faculty member is offering is clashing with a slot in which a core course is offered and the prospective audience for the elective course and the core course are the same.<br>
(ii) if two core courses of a certain program in a given semester are in the same slot it can cause serious issues while students are trying to register. <br>
(b) if the class room allotted is large enough to accommodate the expected strength and has the right infrastructure. It is also preferable that class rooms for core courses of a specific program (M.Tech) are in the vicinity of each other.<br>

# Course registration and add/drop

Students typically register for the subsequent semester courses at the end of current semester. 
At the beginning of a semester, the students may request to add/ drop course(s)
through workflow during the allotted window as per the academic calendar. The faculty advisor and 
course faculty need to approve the requests through workflow.

# Things to do in the first week of classes

1. Clearly communicate the evaluation pattern. Later it must be approved by Class Committee (constituted by the department in the beginning of the semester to ensure the smooth conduct of the course).   
   Typical evaluation pattern: 20-30% each for Quiz I & Quiz II, 0-20% for assignments, and **40-60% (to be strictly adhered for theory courses) for an end semester exam.**   
2. Course Outline  
3. Introduce TAs  
4. Office hours- yours as well as TAs   
5. Check attendance frequently through the Digiicampus app.   
6. Make the students aware of the [academic dishonesty policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FsL6pEcQvDBfmM-Euj4BP8-DhJuvRg8i/view) which lists graded punishments for various academic malpractices and unfair means during examinations and assignments.  
7. Let the students know that they should follow an official process (through workflow) to request for taking up makeup, supplementary exam or E to D upgradation. Private/ email requests will not be entertained.   
8. Supplementary and makeup exams are conducted on institute stipulated dates at the end of the particular semester, and not later or any other day 

# Specially-abled students
Office of Dean Academic Courses will intimate the department and the faculty concerning the students with special needs in your course.
Each such student may have a different requirement. Please take note of it and follow the guidelines shared.

# Teacher course feedback

* Students give feedback about the course and instructor towards the end of semester.  
* Faculty can view the above anonymous feedback on workflow after the grades are uploaded and approved. 

# Teaching Learning Centre
