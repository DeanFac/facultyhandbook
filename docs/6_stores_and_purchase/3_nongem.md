	- (i)	Finalize tender document detailing the technical specifications of the item to be procured along with additional requirements, including terms & conditions, and timelines.
			Tender should indicate that a 2-Bid System is mandatory: 
			(a) Technical bid detailing technical specifications of the product that vendor is supplying (without financial details); 
			(b) Financial bid. The vendors should be instructed to provide them in separate sealed envelopes. 
			Subsequently, the tender has to be floated mandatorily on the [Institute’s Tender Portal](https://tenders.iitm.ac.in/) and the [CPPP](https://eprocure.gov.in/epublish/app).

	- (ii)	After tender deadline, the committee members have to sign on all the envelopes. First, **<u>only technical bids</u>** are opened in presence of the committee. After opening, the committee will sign on all the technical bids. 

	- (iii)	Following this, the end user is required to provide a comparative statement between the technical requirements provided in tender and the technical specifications offered in the technical bids.

	- (iv)	Based on technical comparative statement shared by the end user, the committee shortlists only those vendors who meet the technical requirements. Only for these selected/ qualified vendors, financial bids are opened by the committee who will sign on the envelope (before opening) and the financial bid (after opening). 

	- (v)	Once the financial bids are opened, order shall be placed **<u>only</u>** with the lowest bidder (L1) among the opened financial bids.

DO NOT OPEN THE FINANCIAL BIDS IF THEY DID NOT QUALIFY TECHNICALLY. If the financial bids are opened, the order HAS TO BE placed ONLY with the lowest bidder.
