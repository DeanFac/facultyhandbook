# Payment mechanisms for purchases
1. Payment after item is received- the goods are entered in Stores Received Book (SRB) and **final payment is released by S&P only after the vendor provides tax invoice and any additional documents (warranty certificate, installation certificate, service report) as applicable.** <br><br>
2. Advance payment - With the approval of the Chairman (SPC/ PPC) certain reliable vendors maybe given partial/ full advance payment against proforma invoice, if it is the standard industry practice for such items.<br><br>
3. Letter of credit (LC) - Import purchases are usually handled through letter of credit. <br><br>
4. Reimbursement - Items costing <Rs.25000 can be directly purchased and receipts submitted for reimbursement, subject to administrative budget approval. <br><br>
5. Imprest/ Pre-paid debit card - Departments have a prepaid debit card that can be used for purchase as in item (d). ICSR also issues a consolidated (across projects) higher value prepaid card for Principal Investigators (PIs). <br><br>
6. Corporate credit card - Departments have corporate credit cards which can be used as substitute for (e). <br><br>

* **Disposal of condemned, unserviceable and scrap items:** When the write-off proposals are received from the department office (as per given format), the S & P section disposes the items through e-auction.
