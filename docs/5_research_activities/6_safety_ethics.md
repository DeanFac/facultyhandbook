# Safety and Ethics in Research

Institute has a Safety officer in charge of periodic inspections to ensure conformity to safety protocols. <br>
Some of the common things to keep in mind are listed below: 
-	Please ensure that exit routes are identified and displayed in the research facilities and are always free of obstacles. In general, it is a good practice to ensure that not more than 3 doors need to be opened to go outside the building.
-	Passages have to be at least 5 feet wide. 
-	Make sure all electric wirings are appropriately concealed. Periodically, check for earthing issues. 
-	Always ensure that a duplicate key (office and lab) is deposited at the building’s office.
-	Please ensure appropriate personal protective apparel (gloves, masks, goggles, lab coats, etc.) are provided for in the lab. Insist on appropriate footwear. 
-	If heavier / sharper objects (including gas cylinders and containers) are routinely handled, they should be chained/ restrained, and not free standing. 
-	All labs should have first-aid kits. Check periodically to ensure that they are within their expiry date. 
-	It is a good practice to ensure that at least one other person is present while conducting experiments. 
-	Hazardous waste (oil, flammable liquids, solvents, corrosive liquids, process wastes/residues and sludges, filters and filter materials, contaminated containers) have to be stored in stored in container / drums under covered shed and appropriately labelled. Periodically, Engineering Unit will send out an email notification to all departments to dispose these. 
-	E-waste & outdated/ non-functioning equipment which have Stores Received Book (SRB) entries have to be disposed through a condemnation committee coordinated by department office/ stores. 
-	To dispose radioactive material, contact the **Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)** who will in turn connect with the approved vendor and approve the disposal. 
-	**TO CHECK: Bio Medical Waste Disposal should be done through registered vendors. While there is no centralized process for this, contact the department for guidelines.** 
-	**IITM Institutional Human/ Animal Ethics Committee’s** approval is mandatory for academic research projects, which involve the participation of human/ animal subjects and volunteers. 
-	Research proposals involving recombinant and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)/systems, or pathogenic microorganisms require approval from the **Institutional Biosafety committee (IBSC)** before commencement. All proposals must be submitted against a call to the IBSC (Email: [ibsc@zmail.iitm.ac.in](ibsc@zmail.iitm.ac.in)).

There are specific rules for disposal of chemicals, hazardous and biomedical waste. Check [Engineering Unit Handbook](https://enggunit.iitm.ac.in/includes/pdf/Handbook-EU-corrected-FINAL.pdf)
