# Safety

IIT Madras has a Safety officer in charge of periodic inspections to ensure conformity to safety protocols. <br>
Some of the common things to keep in mind are listed below: 
-	Please ensure that exit routes are identified and displayed in the research facilities and are always free of obstacles. In general, it is a good practice to ensure that not more than 3 doors need to be opened to go outside the building.
-	Passages have to be at least 5 feet wide. 
-	Make sure all electric wirings are appropriately concealed. Periodically, check for earthing issues. 
-	Always ensure that a duplicate key (office and lab) is deposited at the building’s office.
-	Please ensure appropriate personal protective apparel (gloves, masks, goggles, lab coats, etc.) are provided for in the lab. Insist on appropriate footwear. 
-	If heavier / sharper objects (including gas cylinders and containers) are routinely handled, they should be chained/ restrained, and not free standing. 
-	All labs should have first-aid kits. Check periodically to ensure that they are within their expiry date. 
-	It is a good practice to ensure that at least one other person is present while conducting experiments. 

# Disposal Mechanism
-	Hazardous waste (oil, flammable liquids, solvents, corrosive liquids, process wastes/residues and sludges, filters and filter materials, contaminated containers) have to be stored in stored in container / drums under covered shed and appropriately labelled. Periodically, Engineering Unit will send out an email notification to all departments to dispose these. 
-	E-waste & outdated/ non-functioning equipment which have Stores Received Book (SRB) entries have to be disposed through a condemnation committee coordinated by department office/ stores. 
-	To dispose radioactive material, contact the **Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)** who will in turn connect with the approved vendor and approve the disposal. 
-	Bio Medical Waste Disposal should be done through registered vendors. While there is no centralized process for this, contact the department for guidelines.

There are specific rules for disposal of chemicals, hazardous and biomedical waste. Check [Engineering Unit Handbook](https://enggunit.iitm.ac.in/includes/pdf/Handbook-EU-corrected-FINAL.pdf)


# Ethics
-	**IITM Institutional Human/ Animal Ethics Committee’s** approval is mandatory for academic research projects, which involve the participation of human/ animal subjects and volunteers. 
-	Research proposals involving recombinant and genetically modified organisms (GMOs)/systems, or pathogenic microorganisms require approval from the **Institutional Biosafety committee (IBSC)** before commencement. All proposals must be submitted against a call to the IBSC (Email: [ibsc@zmail.iitm.ac.in](ibsc@zmail.iitm.ac.in)).


# Plagiarism Detection Tool

IITM has an institutional account for *Turnitin*, a plagiarism detection software that can be used to check reports, assignments, theses, and research manuscripts for similarity. Faculty members can be added to this IITM account by contacting the Central Library. The Deputy Librarian may be contacted for assistance (Extension: 4954 / 4951). Once an account is created using the IITM email ID, it becomes possible to log in to *Turnitin* and submit files for plagiarism checks.

**When submitting files to *Turnitin*, it is important to unselect the option for keeping the file in the repository. Otherwise, the file will remain in the *Turnitin* repository, and future submissions of the same or similar content (for instance, by collaborators or students) will show a 100% similarity match.**
