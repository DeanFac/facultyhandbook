# MS Thesis evaluations

For MS Thesis evaluation, guide suggests 2 examiners. HoD will choose one examiner. Examiner is given 4 weeks' time to give a report. If the reviewer commens are received, the candidate has to give response and revise the thesis, and send it to GTC. Based on the response, GTC may recommend/ waive the viva. If reviewer comments are not received in 4 weeks, MS thesis viva is conducted to consider awarding the degree.
