**Centre for Industrial consultancy & sponsored research ([ICSR](https://icsr.iitm.ac.in/)) headed by Dean (ICSR) coordinates the activities related to extramural funding, including research sponsorship by governmental agencies and consultancy projects sanctioned by industry.**

# ICSR Activities 


  * [TULA portal](https://icsris.iitm.ac.in/) for managing project-related activities (funds, staff, invoice, etc.)

  * Management and audit of sanctioned funds, issue of utilisation certificates (UC), statement of expenditure (SE), issue of invoice, etc. 
  
  * Under exceptional circumstances, if the sanctioned project is yet to receive funds, but needs to incur expenditure (detailed justification to be provided), ICSR may enable negative balance in the project. 

  * Project-related staff recruitment, purchases, and travel.

  * Link funding agencies with faculty – identify opportunities and bring to the notice of faculty; follow up with different agencies.

  * Draft and manage MoUs / Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)/ Joint Development Agreement (JDAs) and other legal agreements through Legal Cell.

  * Intellectual property management (through IP Cell)– filing of patents (national and international), following up on licensing/ technology transfer \- [https://icsr.iitm.ac.in/patent.php](https://icsr.iitm.ac.in/patent.php) , [https://ipm.icsr.in/ipm/](https://ipm.icsr.in/ipm/)

# Internal Funding Opportunities 

Faculty shall not consider the internal funding opportunities as a main source of funding. It is only to augment one's research ambitions. The IIT system expects faculty to secure large scale funding from [government](http://facportal.iitm.ac.in/fachandbook/projects_funding/#govt-funding-agencies) and non-governmental agencies.
