# Admission timelines and allocation of regular HTRA seats

* Admissions to MS/ PhD happens in two cycles. Application deadlines are March 31<sup>st</sup> and October 31<sup>st</sup> for 
intake in July and Jan respectively.   
* The institute allocates a fixed number of new Regular-HTRA seats to each department every year based 
on the current faculty strength. 
The department evolves its own policy for allocating these students to faculty in a fair and equitable manner
while keeping in mind the interests of the student to the extent possible. 

# How to attract good research scholars?

1. **Outreach:** While travelling for any purpose, especially GATE/ JEE exam duties, 
use the opportunity to give talks in reputed colleges in the region to attract good research scholars.
2. **Summer Fellowship Programme:** See the [link](https://ssp.iitm.ac.in/summer-fellowship-registration) for further information. 
The institute solicits applications from non- IIT undergraduates from 3<sup>rd</sup> year and above for 
internships at IIT Madras for 2 months. Candidates are selected by the Department. They are potential research scholars.

3. **MoU with NITs:**  
IITM has MoUs with several NITs (see the [link](https://ge.iitm.ac.in/mou/national-universities)) where the top 
performing students (at the end of 6<sup>th</sup> semester) can complete their 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> semester of their BTech program at IITM. 
In general, students who performed well during their tenure at IITM are eligible to MS+PhD program admissions at IITM 
without GATE/interview.

# Other avenues for institute funded human resources 

In addition to HTRA scholars, the institute offers the following:

1. **Institute Post Doctoral Fellowship (IPDF)** ([https://www.iitm.ac.in/careers/post-doctoral-opportunities](https://www.iitm.ac.in/careers/post-doctoral-opportunities)): Selected via a two-step process. A research proposal is expected to be evolved based on interaction between the candidate and the mentor before the candidate submits the application.    
* Eligibility:   
* Within five years after completion of Ph.D. Maximum Age is 35 years (Relaxed by 5 years for women and reserved category).   
* Ph.D. scholars after submission of thesis can also apply for Institute PDF posts.  
* Duration: Initially for 2 years, extendable to one more year based on the progress of the PDF and the recommendation of the Department.


2. To encourage women who have taken a minimum of 2 years career break to get back to research, 
the institute offers **Post-Doctoral Fellowship for Women with Break in Career.**
