Faculty members who are not availing the services of the Balmer Lawrie Desk at ICSR may also use the Balmer Lawrie self-booking option for travel. Self-booking can be done either through the general IIT Madras account or through individual accounts registered as Government of India users.

* The general IITM account may be used by those who do not have individual accounts to login to [the website](https://ssbt.balmerlawrietravelapp.com/Account/UserLogin). For login details, contact ICSR at [smstrategy-icsr@imail.iitm.ac.in](smstrategy-icsr@imail.iitm.ac.in).

* An individual IITM account can be created using [this link](https://govemp.balmerlawrietravelapp.com/Traveller/ICISTravellerRegistration). Only the official IITM email address should be used for registration. Activation of the account may take 1–2 working days. Once activated, tickets can be booked through [the link](https://govemp.balmerlawrietravelapp.com/Account/UserLogin?ReturnUrl=%2fSettings%2fLoginProfile). Dependents can also be added under the same account, and bookings may be made on their behalf.
