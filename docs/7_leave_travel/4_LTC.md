**LTC for all faculty and dependents** : Travel costs (air/ train/ govt. bus) will be reimbursed. Up to 10 days of EL can be encashed for other expenses.

* In a block of 4 years you can visit the declared hometown twice (once in every two year sub-block). Optionally one of the hometown visits can be used to travel anywhere in India. Hometown is as per declaration given at the time of joining. The hometown can be changed only once after the initial declaration. 

* From time to time the government permits conversion of hometown visits to North East Region, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Andaman & Nicobar.

* Current (as of September 2025) four-year block is 2022-2025 and the two year sub-block is 2024-2025. There is also a one-year grace period–the block ending in 2025 can be availed up to Dec 31,2026. 

* Newly recruited faculty have a special provision to visit their hometown every year for eight years after the completion of one year of service. LTC in the 5th and 9th year of service can be converted to travel anywhere in India. There is no grace period in the new recruit special provision. 
     <br> -	Once a faculty completes probation, the period in the remainder could be the first time he/she avails LTC.  Eg: Suppose a faculty joins in November 2024. He/she completes probation in November 2025, then during Nove-Dec 2025 the faculty may avail his/her first LTC. 

* Prior intimation through workflow is **mandatory** before availing LTC. You can request for an advance upto 90% of travel cost at the time of intimation. If advance is drawn, the claim should be submitted within one month from the date of return journey. If no advance is taken, the claim should be submitted within three months from the date of completion of the return journey.
