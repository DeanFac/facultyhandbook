# UI Components

Just the Docs includes styles for displaying clear and readable typography, nicely formatted code, and easily identifiable buttons. The goal of this theme is to make it as easy as possible to write code documentation in markdown and have the Just the Docs take care of the rest, so very few CSS classes are required to render commonly used UI elements.
